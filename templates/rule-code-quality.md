# Code Quality Reminders

## Code Simplification
After significant file edits (5+), consider running code-simplifier agent.

## Post-Planning
After creating an implementation plan, always activate the cook skill before implementation.

## Modularization
If a code file exceeds 200 lines, consider modularizing it.
